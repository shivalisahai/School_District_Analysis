# School_District_Analysis

## Overview:

This analysis is for finding out any academic dishonesty in reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. Data is used from two given csv files - schools_complete.csv & students_complete.csv and merged in to a common dataframe with analysis performed for all grades of reading and math scores and then another analysis performed with cleaned data by removing math and reading scores for ninth graders of Thomas High School and then comparing the metrics from both analyses. This report highlights any observed changes between the two analyses. These analyses also contain results of the district summary, school summary, top 5 & bottom 5 performing schools (based on the overall passing rate), average math & reading score for each grade level from each school, scores by school spending per student, scores by school size & scores by school type.
